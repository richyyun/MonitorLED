# MonitorLED

A simple project for custom made LED strip lights for a computer monitor using addressable LED strips, an Arduino Uno, and a Python script for communication. Note: needs an external power source to power all the LEDs as the Arduino does not supply enough.

The Example.mp4 file is a short video of it in action.
